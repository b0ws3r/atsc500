## Overview
Term project for UBC ATSC 500. 

_Surface Energy Budget and Seasonal Boundary Layer Behavior over Varied Arctic Ice_ 

- Relevant code is in [final_cmip_3hr.ipynb](https://github.com/b0ws3r/atsc500/blob/master/final_cmip_3hr.ipynb).
- All other projects WIP as I get things into nice non-notebook libraries

- Code looks at biases in GFDL CM4 model compared to observations at summit station, Greenland. Observation data is from Arctic Data Center.
- Data:
    - Surface energy budget at Summit, Greenland
    - Matthew Shupe and Nathaniel Miller
